# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrect handling of null values.  The `bug.js` file shows the error, and `bugSolution.js` shows the correct implementation.

## The Problem

Many JavaScript functions don't explicitly handle null values, leading to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.  This example shows a simple function that correctly handles nulls by returning null.
